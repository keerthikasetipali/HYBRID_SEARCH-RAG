**Hybrid Search Using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**


This repository demonstrates a hybrid search approach using the RAG model, which combines retrieval-based search with generative question-answering. The RAG model leverages both retrieval from a knowledge base (such as documents, PDFs, or a vector store) and a language model to provide accurate answers to complex queries.

**Overview**


Hybrid Search using RAG enables efficient and accurate information retrieval by:

Retrieving relevant passages or documents from a pre-defined corpus using traditional or vector-based search methods (such as dense vector embeddings).
Generating an answer based on the retrieved information using a generative language model like GPT or BART.
This approach is particularly useful for large knowledge bases where pure retrieval or generative models may fail to provide accurate results on their own.

**Key Features**


Combines retrieval (search) and generation (answer synthesis) for high-quality answers.
Works with various types of data sources, including text files, PDFs, and vector embeddings.
Supports hybrid search, allowing the model to switch between dense (vector-based) and sparse (keyword-based) retrieval.
Capable of handling diverse queries and understanding complex contexts using the RAG model.

**Requirements**


The project requires the following libraries:

transformers for the RAG model
faiss-cpu for dense vector search
datasets for loading and handling data
langchain for implementing retrieval workflows
pytorch for model handling and inference
Ensure you have these in your environment.

**Usage**
Data Preparation
Before running the model, you need to prepare the dataset or documents for hybrid search. This can be done by:

Loading documents into a vector store (e.g., FAISS) for dense retrieval.
Indexing documents for sparse (keyword-based) search using a traditional search engine or a vectorizer.
